# Project-Rosalind
[Problem Solved](http://rosalind.info/users/ling_min/): 95/285

This is a programming exercise I started from September 2021 where I had to solve as many problems as I can from rosalind.info. This code repository contains a complete solutions to all problems that I have solved at rosalind.info. The name code for each python file corresponds to the problem number code at the website.

## Disclaimer
This repository is aimed to showcase my programming/portfolio to my potential interviewers. But it could be a great reference for Rosalind learners. Yet, use it wisely !
1) Do not simply copy, paste and submit the code from this repo. It does not help you to learn bioinformatics. Rosalind.info has the highest quality but limited bioinformatics problem and it would be a waste of chances to learn if you simply copy everything from here ! Instead, you should treat this repository as a reference as you go through the problem.
2) If you are stucked with any problems or conceptual understanding, it is okay to refer to my code, learn the main idea, and go back to solve the problem on your own. To maximise the learning, I purposely do not put comments on what I did in the code file. This is to encourage the learners to read my code and interpret the code on their own. On the other hand, my code is imperfect, and there exists better way to approach the problems. So I strongly encourage not even to refer to my code if possible. 
3) If you spot any mistakes, feel free to email lingminhao31@gmail.com. ENJOY !
